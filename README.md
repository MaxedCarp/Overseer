# Overseer

NOT an Armored Core VI reference!
However, Overseer is still designed to: Observe, Prevent and Intervene

From detailed new user statistics to role and nickname persistence, Overseer handles your server's moderation logging systems just fine!

**-----------------------------------------**

A Discord moderation bot designed to log server and member events such as:

- Message Deletions
- Message Edits
- Username changes
- Global name changes
- Avatar changes
- Members bans
- Moderation commands

Additional features currently available:

### Overseer can...
- *Open a mod panel for a user through context actions (Right click user => apps => Open Moderation Panel).
- Timeout members for a specific duration.
- Ban members temporarily (the ban will be removed automatically after the specified time has passed).
- Send "Welcome" and "Farewell" massages, including embeds.
- Provide detailed informations on users when they join or leave.
- Give members a role or multiple roles when they join.
- Give members a role when they type something into the chat (can also add a time-since-join requirement).
- Ban a specific user when they join the server (auto / pre bans).
- A note system, similar to a warning system except it is designed to provide information rather than a punishment.
